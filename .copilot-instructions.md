# GitHub Copilot Workspace-Specific Instructions

## 🎯 Project Context
This is an **Enhanced AI-Native Educational Testing Platform** with sophisticated semantic API intelligence. 

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Mandatory Tool Usage for API Operations

**FOR ANY USER REQUEST involving API calls, data retrieval, or testing platform operations, ALWAYS use the semantic API intelligence tool:**

```bash
node tools/ai-api-call.mjs "<user-request-or-endpoint>"
```

### Examples:
- User asks: "Show me student data" → Use: `node tools/ai-api-call.mjs "student data"`
- User asks: "Get active tests" → Use: `node tools/ai-api-call.mjs "active tests"`  
- User asks: "Call /event/query" → Use: `node tools/ai-api-call.mjs "/event/query"`

## 🧠 System Capabilities

This workspace contains:
- **84 API endpoints** with comprehensive semantic intelligence
- **Educational domain mapping**: student → examinee, test → event, score → result
- **Automatic parameter injection**: program-id, institution-id universally added
- **Business context interpretation**: AI explains responses in educational testing context
- **Test-informed intelligence**: Real usage patterns inform API behavior

## ✅ Tool Benefits

1. **Semantic Discovery**: Natural language automatically finds correct endpoints
2. **Domain Expertise**: Built-in understanding of educational testing terminology  
3. **Intelligent Parameter Handling**: Universal parameters injected automatically
4. **Business Interpretation**: Technical responses translated to business context
5. **Error Guidance**: Actionable troubleshooting suggestions
6. **Structured Output**: Both human and machine-readable results

## 🔧 Quick Verification

Test the system with: `node tools/ai-api-call.mjs "active tests"`

Expected: Semantic mapping, endpoint discovery, API call with business context.

## 📊 Architecture

- **Richardson Maturity Model Level 3** (Hypermedia controls)
- **AI-Native Design** with semantic interfaces
- **Test-Informed Intelligence** from real API usage patterns
- **Enhanced error handling** with business context

This system is **MORE sophisticated than external MCP servers** due to domain-specific intelligence.

## ⚠️ Important

**Never make direct API calls without using the semantic intelligence tool.** The workspace is designed for conversational, intelligent API exploration that understands educational testing domain context.

Always leverage the built-in semantic discovery and business interpretation capabilities.
