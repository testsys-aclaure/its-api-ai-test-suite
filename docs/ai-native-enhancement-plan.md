# AI-Native Enhancement Plan

## Current State vs AI-Native Standards

### What's Working Well ✅
- **Rich metadata** with business context
- **Semantic interfaces** for natural language access
- **Business-friendly aliases** for common operations
- **Environment-driven configuration** patterns

### Critical Gaps ❌
- **No hypermedia controls** (Richardson Level 3)
- **Limited self-descriptive responses**
- **Basic error handling** without business context
- **No content negotiation** for different AI agents

## Enhancement Strategy

### Phase 1: Hypermedia Controls
Add `_links` to all responses for AI navigation:

```typescript
// Enhanced response structure
{
  data: { /* actual response data */ },
  _metadata: {
    businessContext: "Clear business explanation",
    semanticMeaning: "What this response means",
    nextActions: ["Specific actionable steps"]
  },
  _links: {
    self: { href: "current-resource-uri" },
    related: [
      { rel: "parent", href: "/parent-resource" },
      { rel: "children", href: "/child-resources" }
    ],
    actions: {
      "filter-by-institution": { 
        href: "/event/query?program-id={program}&program-institution-id={institution}",
        method: "GET",
        title: "Filter events by institution"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Self-Descriptive Messages
Every response explains itself:

```typescript
_metadata: {
  businessDomain: "Event Management",
  operation: "Event Discovery",
  businessLogic: "Returns all accessible events for program",
  dataInterpretation: {
    totalEvents: "Number of events found",
    activeOnly: "Filtered to non-expired events only"
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Error Context
AI-friendly error responses:

```typescript
{
  error: {
    httpStatus: 422,
    businessTitle: "No Events Found",
    businessExplanation: "Program 238 has no events accessible to institution 1009048",
    troubleshooting: {
      likelyCause: "Institution access restrictions",
      solutions: [
        "Try different institution ID",
        "Verify program access permissions"
      ]
    }
  },
  _links: {
    help: { href: "/docs/troubleshooting/no-events" },
    alternative: { href: "/event/query?program-id=238" }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **Base Enhancement** - Add `_links` and `_metadata` to existing endpoints
2. **Error Enhancement** - Upgrade all error responses with business context  
3. **Content Negotiation** - Support HAL+JSON and JSON:API formats
4. **Discovery Enhancement** - Add endpoint capability descriptions

## Success Metrics

- AI agents can navigate without prior endpoint knowledge
- Error responses provide actionable business guidance
- All responses are self-explanatory
- Natural language queries map perfectly to API calls
