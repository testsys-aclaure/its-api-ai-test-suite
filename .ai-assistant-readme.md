# 🤖 AI Assistant Workspace Instructions

**CRITICAL: This workspace has a sophisticated semantic API intelligence system that MUST be used for all API-related requests.**

## 🚨 MANDATORY TOOL USAGE

For **ANY** user request involving API calls, data retrieval, or testing platform operations, **ALWAYS** use the semantic API tool:

```bash
node tools/ai-api-call.mjs "<user-request>"
```

## 📋 Quick Reference Card

### Natural Language Examples
- "Show me student data" → `node tools/ai-api-call.mjs "student data"`
- "Get active tests" → `node tools/ai-api-call.mjs "active tests"`
- "Find test results" → `node tools/ai-api-call.mjs "test results"`
- "List event classes" → `node tools/ai-api-call.mjs "event classes"`
- "Check institutions" → `node tools/ai-api-call.mjs "institutions"`

### Direct Endpoint Examples  
- "Call /event/query" → `node tools/ai-api-call.mjs "/event/query"`
- "Get events with filters" → `node tools/ai-api-call.mjs "/event/query" active-only=true limit=5`
- "Check timezones" → `node tools/ai-api-call.mjs "/Timezone/Query"`

## 🎯 Why This Tool is Required

This workspace contains an **AI-Native Educational Testing Platform** with:

- **84 API endpoints** with semantic intelligence
- **Educational domain mapping** (student → examinee, test → event)
- **Automatic parameter injection** (program-id, institution-id)
- **Business context interpretation** for all responses
- **Test-informed intelligence** from real usage patterns

## ⚠️ DO NOT USE Instead

❌ Direct API calls without intelligence
❌ Raw curl commands  
❌ Manual endpoint construction
❌ Hardcoded parameter assumptions

## ✅ Expected Behavior

The tool provides:
1. **Semantic Discovery**: Maps natural language to endpoints
2. **Intelligent Parameter Injection**: Adds required universal parameters
3. **Business Context**: Educational testing domain interpretation
4. **Structured Output**: Both human-readable and machine-readable results
5. **Error Guidance**: Actionable troubleshooting suggestions

## 🔍 Tool Verification

To verify the system is working, test with:
```bash
node tools/ai-api-call.mjs "active tests"
```

Expected output should include:
- Semantic mapping results
- Endpoint discovery
- API call with business interpretation
- Structured JSON output

## 📚 Architecture Context

This workspace implements:
- **Richardson Maturity Model Level 3** (Hypermedia controls)
- **Test-Informed Intelligence** (behavior patterns from real usage)
- **Enhanced AI-Native API Architecture**
- **Comprehensive semantic endpoint discovery**

The system is **MORE sophisticated than external MCP servers** because it contains domain-specific intelligence for educational testing platforms.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Always use the semantic API tool** for any API request
2. **Start with natural language** - the system will find the right endpoint
3. **Check the structured output** for machine-readable results
4. **Use the business interpretation** to understand responses in educational context

**Remember: This workspace has built-in intelligence that makes API exploration conversational and context-aware. Use it!**
